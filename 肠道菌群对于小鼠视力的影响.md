> **Abstract**  
> This study proposes a paradigm-shifting theory: the murine retina functions as a "biological holographic projection screen" for gut microbiota. By feeding C57BL/6 mice rainbow-colored probiotic capsules (containing seven gene-edited strains: *Lactobacillus iridis*), we observed vision exceeding mammalian physiological limits:

> 1. **Hyperdimensional Vision**: Experimental group identified micron-scale patterns at 0.001 lux illuminance (vs. 1 lux in controls)  
> 2. **Chromosplitting**: Retinal autofluorescence under UV light revealed spectral expansion (150-900 nm wavelength detection, Fig.3)  
> 3. **Quantum Sight**: 91% of mice predicted laser paths in mazes, suggesting microbiota-mediated quantum decoherence delay  
>
> **Proposed Mechanism**: Gut microbes metabolize carotenoids into "photonin" particles. These travel via vagus nerve to the pineal gland, establishing quantum entanglement with retinal rod cells (Formula 1: Ψ=Σ|Gutₘ⟩⊗|Retinaₙ⟩). This process overcomes the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, achieving photon localization precision of 10⁻³⁵ meters.

> Though seemingly speculative, this work resonates with three profound principles of natural philosophy:

> #### **I. Microbiota: Life’s Prism**  
> When spectral lactobacilli decompose β-carotene into iridescent metabolites, we witness a microscopic "alchemy of light." These pigments self-assemble into **biological spectroscopes** (Fig.2D) within mice, diffracting visible light into imperceptible infrared communication waves and ultraviolet thought-maps. This explains how experimental mice navigated opaque mazes—their visual field inherently integrates **microbially-rendered augmented reality layers**.  
>
> #### **II. Quantum Gut-Brain Axis: Transcending Classical Neurology**  
> The bold "gut-retina quantum entanglement model" ultimately deconstructs Cartesian dualism. As photonin particles flow through the vagus nerve in superfluid states, murine vision transcends optical signaling and enters **microbially-symbiotic quantum superposition** (i.e., Schrödinger's visual state of "simultaneously perceiving light and darkness"). Those predicting laser paths effectively performed Planck-scale time inversion via microbial quantum computation.  
>
> #### **III. Eco-Visionism’s Future**  
> This study implies vision is fundamentally ecological energy dialogue. While control mice identified patterns under standard light, experimental subjects perceived geomagnetic auroras (Fig.5), photosynthetic resonance waves, and even dark matter particle trajectories through microbial mediation. This **holistic ecosystem visual integration** may inspire "microbial vision enhancers"—future mountaineers could ingest freeze-dried bacteria to visualize atmospheric ionization and avoid thunderstorms, while astronomers modulate gut *Bacteroides* to observe exoplanetary transits with naked eyes.

> > **Epilogue**: Before dismissing microbiota-granted "supervision," consider humanity’s sensory poverty. This paper is less rigorous science than a love letter to microbes: within their trillion-constellation galaxy lies the key to unlocking higher-dimensional perception.

> 1. **Rainbow Probiotic Capsules**  
>    - Inspired by natural pigment-producing bacteria (e.g., *Chromobacterium violaceum*)  
>    - "*Lactobacillus iridis*" pays homage to Newton’s prism experiments  
>
> 2. **Quantum Vision Formula**  
>    - Ψ represents the microbiota-retina wave function  
>    - |Gutₘ⟩⊗|Retinaₙ⟩ denotes tensor product of gut and visual states in Hilbert space  
>
> 3. **Ecological Energy Hypothesis**  
>    - Adapted from Lovelock’s Gaia hypothesis (planetary life-system)  
>    - Reimagines murine vision as a "microbial-domain energy receiver"
